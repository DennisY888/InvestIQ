Session vs JWT tokens:
    after user enters the correct credentials (username and password)...
    - session data stored in backend (server, database, etc)
    - JWT tokens (containing meta data) stored in frontend (local storage)
        - access token and refresh token
        - once refresh token expires we actually have to sign back in again to make more requests to server
    - BOTH store meta data such as user ID, authentcation state, permission level, etc.



Django REST framework vs Django:
    - Instead of function-based views, we now use class-based views
    - Instead of manually returning JSON responses in our functions, we assign serializers to class-based views


Serializers:
    - takes a python object (data from model through ORM) and converts to JSON data to return the response (API)
    - can take in python code and convert to JSON and vice versa


Security:
    - we protect BOTH front-end and back-end routes, not just back-end
    - a user could technically bypass front-end authorization checks, but still good to include 
      and prevent sending unneccesary requests


Deployment:
    - we first deploy the database
    - then we deploy the backend which needs a git repository


*** EVERYTHING we did to deploy on choreo:
hosting database:
    - create choreo account
    - dependencies -> databases -> create a new database (free trial only has one)
    - react_django -> backend -> .env -> store all database host properties as environment variables
    - react_django -> backend -> backend -> settings.py -> change DATABASES variable fields
    - run in terminal: python3 manage.py migrate ( a new database will be created on their server and previous data will be gone )

hosting backend:
    - add .gitignore to react_django, backend, and frontend folders and ignore all .env files as well as db.sqlite3
    - create .choreo folder
